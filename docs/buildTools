Comparison of build tools.
gb
pros:
 -- can keep everything under version control.
 -- can have multiple main packages.
 -- easy updates.
 -- tightly coupled to the version of go.
cons:
 -- breaks go run, and the rest of the go toolchain.
 -- can not do diamond dependencies.
 -- has to be installed using go get.
 -- very immature

godep
pros:
 -- mature
 -- not tightly coupled
 -- doesn't break go toolchain
 -- maybe can do diamond dependencies
cons:
 -- rewrites imports.

gev(roll our own, chosen)
pros:
 -- completely not coupled -- ships its own go.
 -- familiar, like venv
 -- would have to use similar for binary dependencies anyway.
 -- doesn't break almost any go tools (and can ship its own go tools anyway if there's need).
 -- requires no installation and is a single "source activate" setup.
cons:
 -- can't do diamond dependencies (can't do without import rewriting anyway).
 -- breaks go get (which sucks anyway)
 -- requires advanced knowledge of git, and I still don't get submodules.
