# 2048wc
2048wc is an implementation of a business idea for a website, where people can challenge their facebook, twitter or gmail (google+) friends in 2048 and win (or loose) bragging rights or tiny amount of money from each other.

To generate documentation for the project run createDoc. To run unit tests go to test directory and run "go test".

There is no webserver to run (yet).
